# FrontEnd-Calculator-project
Submission of frontend project my captain
I have used nested Linear layouts amd nested weights for creating the UI.
i have also used material designs to add ripple effect on clicking buttons as you can see in screenshot on button "5" 
made some buttons with rounded corners using corner radius attribute.
chose colours that would be easy on eyes

Thank you for reviewing....
